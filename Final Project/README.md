# Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction

## 1.1 Problem Statement
One out of every death is a death due to undiagnosed heart attack. Heart Attack is still one of the major issues in today's technologically advanced world. Till date also many people die due to undiagnosed Heart Attacks. Since it's never too late to solve a problem, in this project I would be trying to somehow predict Heart Attack by using a Dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle.com</a>

## 1.2 Solution
One of the solution to this problem maybe creating an Artificial Intelligence Enabled Model which would be trained on a huge dataset which would contain some of the mostly seen symptoms of Heart Attacks seen during these long years.

## 1.3 AI Domain
The Artificial Intelligence Domain which is used is "Data Science or Statistical Data".

## 1.4 SDG Goal
This project would be somehow helping in achieving the 3rd Sustainable Development Goal which is "Good Health and Well Being".
