On the other hand, the videos that you most likely will want to watch (watched by other people who liked the same videos as you) will be the labels or the targets to the model/technique.

    "<font color=blue>Bonus: There is also another method to convert categories to numbers. The method is known as one-hot encoding. One-hot encoding changes the categories into binary (0 or 1) categories. For example, if you have raining or sunny days as categories, one hot encoding will add 2 more columns, rainy and sunny, to the dataframe. If the data point shows rainy, it will be converted to a value of 1 under the raining column and a value of 0 under the sunny column (see table below). Read this [article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/) to find out more about one-hot encoding. Now, read this [article](http://queirozf.com/entries/one-hot-encoding-a-feature-on-a-pandas-dataframe-an-example) to learn how to do one-hot encoding for pandas. Import the Iris Flower dataset again as df2 and conduct the one-hot encoding for it.</font>"
